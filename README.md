# Line_Follower_Robot
This project is an Arduino-based PID Line Follower Robot that uses IR sensors to detect a line and PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) control to follow it smoothly. The robot adjusts its motor speeds in real-time based on sensor feedback, allowing it to handle straight paths, sharp turns, and even U-turns efficiently.
